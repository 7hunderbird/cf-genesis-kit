# Improvements

- Added `cflinuxfs3` support.  This will become the default stack after the deploy.  If you still need `cflinuxfs2` as the default stack you can override this in the environment file with `default_stack: cflinuxfs2` under the `params` key.  `cflinuxfs2` is End-of-Life and will be removed in a future release.
