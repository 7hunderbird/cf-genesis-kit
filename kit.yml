  This kit will deploy OSS Cloud Foundry to BOSH. It contains
  subkits to help identify where your databases and blobstore are,
  customizations for Azure environments, and to enable an appropriate
  HA Proxy configuration if desired. It is loosely based off of the
  [cf-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment) repo.
